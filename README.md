# Repository for Practicing Solo Projects


## About The Coffee, Cookie and Coding $\left(C^3\right)$ Workshops

Yale’s [Public Health Data Science and Data Equity (DSDE)](https://ysph.yale.edu/research/research-centers-and-initiatives/public-health-data-science-and-data-equity/) team hosts workshops, tutorials, and information sessions known as Coffee, Cookie and Coding $\left(C^3\right)$ Workshops. These sessions are designed to help Public Health and Biostatistics masters-level students at Yale effectively leverage computational tools and analytical methods in their educational and professional endeavors.

While primarily intended for the Yale community, all are welcome and encouraged to attend and benefit from our offerings. If you are affiliated with Yale, you can set up an office hour appointment with one of the data scientists ([Bookings Page](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DataScienceDataEquityOfficeHours@yale.edu/bookings/)).


## About Workshop

**Workshop Title:** &nbsp; Getting Started with Git and GitHub Part 1

**Last Updated:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; February $11^{\text{th}}$, 2026

**Part 2 Instructor:** [Shelby Golden, M.S.](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/shelby-golden/), Data Scientist I

Upon completing the workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and value of Git and GitHub in managing coding projects.
- Learn how Git manages files for version control locally and distributes them through GitHub.
- Set up and configure your local Git and GitHub accounts using either HTTPS or SSH Keys.


## Overview Of Contents

- **For the analysis:** `Plot Vaccinations.R`
- **R:** version 4.5.2
- **RStudio IDE:** version 2026.01.0+392
- **`renv`:** version 1.1.7. Included to reproduce the coding environment.

All session materials, interactive learning assignments, and codebase links are available in the [Book of Workshops](https://ysph-dsde.github.io/Book-of-Workshops/Workshops/Git-and-GitHub/git-github-index.html) chapter. Some of these materials have been adapted for asynchronous learning in webpage format.


## Using this Repository

This repository contains prepared code for students to practice version control using Git and GitHub with real-world public health data. Please create a "clean-break" of the repository in your own GitHub before cloning it. Directions are available on the [Accessing the Codespaces](https://ysph-dsde.github.io/Book-of-Workshops/Workshops/Git-and-GitHub/git-github-index.html#accessing-the-codespaces) section of this workshop's Book of Workshops webpage.

## About the Data

The [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) (JHU CRC) tracked and compiled global COVID-19 pandemic data from January 22, 2020, to March 10, 2023. This data is publicly available through their two GitHub repositories. For this workshop content, we imported two datasets:

- Cumulative vaccination counts for the U.S. from their [GovEX/COVID-19](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19) GitHub repository. The raw data used in the analysis script can be found in the `data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series` subdirectory ([original source](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/blob/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series/time_series_covid19_vaccine_us.csv)).

- Cumulative case and death counts for the U.S. from their [CSSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) GitHub repository. The raw data for these two datasets used in the analysis can be found in the `csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series` subdirectory ([original source](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)). Both `time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv` and `time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv were used`.

The data dictionaries provided by JHU CRC can be found here: [Vaccinations Dataset Data Dictionary](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data) and [Cases and Deaths Datasets Data Dictionary](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data#usa-daily-state-reports-csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us). For our purposes, we conducted data cleaning, harmonization, and smoothing using isotonic regression. This included harmonizing the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 to 2019 population projections with the 2020 to 2023 vintages.

Details about these steps can be found in the `Git-and-GitHub/Code/Data Cleaning` and `Git-and-GitHub/Code/Population Estimates and Projections` directories ([link to code](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/Book-of-Workshops/tree/main/Workshops/Git-and-GitHub/Code)). The cleaned datasets are in the `Git-and-GitHub/Data` directory ([link to data](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/Book-of-Workshops/tree/main/Workshops/Git-and-GitHub/Data)).
